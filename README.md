Week 4 Project - Integrating Flexbox, Inline Display, and the Box Model


This is the website for the fake cafe called Tea Cozy. The design specs were given to my Code Academy class as the website we needed to re-create for our week 4 project. I have done my best to re-create the website without looking at any of the code from the "inspect" link under DevTools.

The website needed to have a fixed header, with links to different parts of the website. I added a link to the "home" page using the Tea Cozy logo image as an added feature - which was especially helpful when I was testing the other links in the nav bar.

I broke the website into five sections in order to help divide the website into different "boxes":
  Header (Fixed with nav bar and logo)
  Main (The Mission of the Tea Cafe)
  Middle (The Monthly teas and products offered)
  Location (The different imaginary coffee shops)
  Footer

Clearly, by looking at my code, I am totally confused as to how Flexbox really works. I played Flexbox Froggies and went over the Code Academy lessons on the Box Model numerous times. I feel pretty comfortable with the different properties and how they should be used but implementing them was much more obscure.  Often I would try to center the contents and nothing would happen - so I ended up using padding and margins to help me get the desired arrangement.
